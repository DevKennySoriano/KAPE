## About The Project


**Kape't Bahala Na** works as a brand name because it's deeply Filipino, emotional and memorable. It implies that your coffee is there for people during busy days, tough decisions, late nights or moments when you just let things be. 

"**kape muna bahala na yung iba**"

The application focuses on a **User Management System** that supports **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)**.

> ⏱ **Development Timeline:** 2 – 4 days  
> Built as a focused Laravel Week 1 project to practice core framework concepts and CRUD operations.

This project introduces core Laravel concepts such as:
- Laravel project structure
- MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture

- Database via database.sqlite
